# Developing a More Concise Life Insurance Application for Risk Classification
## Overview
* Developed a predictive model that classifies life insurance risk with maximum feature reduction (more than 30%) using Prudential Financialâ€™s Kaggle life insurance dataset.
* This group project involved **exploratory data analysis**, **data cleaning**, feature engineering, **cross-validation**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and training and testing a gradient boosting model (**XGBoost**) for a risk classification with *maximum quadratic weighted kappa score* (a chance-adjusted index of agreement).
